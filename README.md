jointcal validation data
========================

This repository contains data to validate the performance of the [jointcal](http://github.com/lsst/jointcal) product.

Individual sets of testing data should be placed in their own directories, as butler-accessible repositories. They can then be loaded in testing code via the butler and the catalogs fed to jointcal.

The directories contained in this repository are listed below, with a description of their contents.

twinkles1
---------

Twinkles is a synthetic survey produced for the Dark Energy Science Collaboration's first data challenge. The intent with Twinkles is to test detection and analysis of type Ia SNe and strongly lensed quasars. Stars, galaxies and solar system objects were drawn from the LSST universe model. In addition to the standard universe, higher than natural rates of both type Ia SNe and lensed quasar systems were planted in the images. This repository includes one chip for the first 10 r-band visits in a deep drilling field (all observations are on the same night). See [here](https://github.com/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/Twinkles/blob/master/doc/Design.md) for a more complete description of the full survey.

**Note:** the calexps contained in this repository are identically zero and compressed and are only included for their metadata to build the `calexp_md`. If you want to use the twinkles images, please use the link above for details.

twinkles1_and_index
-------------------

Astrometry index catalogs corresponding to the twinkles1 data.

cfht
----

Source catalogs, metadata from the validation_data_cfht repository plus a skyMap. The following directories were copied from validation_data_cfht:

 * data/ -> cfht/
 * astrometry_net_data/ -> cfht_and_index/

Then the icMatch/ and icSrc/ directories were deleted from cfht/ and the calexps were processed via the included `compress_jointcal_cfht_test_data.py` to remove the pixel-level data and gzip compress them to make their size reasonable. I saved a skyMap to deepCoadds, generated by running:

```
makeDiscreteSkyMap.py cfht --output cfht/deepCoadd --id visit=850587^840375 ccd=12 --configfile makeSkyMapConfig.py
```

and this makeSkyMapConfig.py,

```
config.skyMap.projection='TAN'

# dimensions of inner region of patches (x,y pixels)
config.skyMap.patchInnerDimensions=[4000, 4000]

# nominal pixel scale (arcsec/pixel)
config.skyMap.pixelScale=0.185
```

No other changes were made to the data.

cfht_and_index
--------------

Astrometry index catalogs corresponding to the cfht data.

Git LFS
-------

To clone and use this repository, you'll need Git Large File Storage (LFS).
