jointcal validation data
========================

This repository contains data to validate the performance of the [jointcal](http://github.com/lsst/jointcal) product.

Individual sets of testing data should be placed in their own directories, as butler-accessible repositories. They can then be loaded in testing code via the butler and the catalogs fed to jointcal.
